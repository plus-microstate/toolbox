# +microstate toolbox


## About +microstate

+microstate is a MATLAB toolbox for performing microstate analysis in sensor- or source-reconstructed EEG or MEG data. +microstate can be used for individual- or group-level analyses, and applied to both resting-state or task-evoked data. As well as microstate analysis, +microstate includes functions for calculating microstate statistics and microstate-segmented functional connectivity, visualisation, and simulation of data. Basic preprocessing is also available in the toolbox, and for more advanced preprocessing +microstate integrates with a number of pre-exisiting toolboxes for M/EEG processing and analysis. 
## Download and Installation

The easiest way to download the toolbox is to click the following link: 

### [**Download +microstate**](https://github.com/plus-microstate/toolbox/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

Alternatively, the toolbox can be downloaded from [the toolbox GitHub repository](https://github.com/plus-microstate/toolbox). MATLAB must be installed to run +microstate, which has been tested on MATLAB R2017b and higher. Additionally, the following MATLAB toolboxes are required: [Statistics and Machine Learning](https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html), [Signal Processing](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html), and [Wavelet](https://www.mathworks.com/products/wavelet.html). 

To install the toolbox, unzip the downloaded folder (toolbox-master), then open MATLAB and enter 
```markdown
addpath('PATH/toolbox-master')
```
in the MATLAB console (here `PATH` is the location in which you saved the toolbox-master directory, usually `~/Downloads`). You must either do this each time you open MATLAB, or to permenantly add +microstate to the path you can add toolbox-master to the path using MATLAB's `pathtool` function. 

You can check that the toolbox is properly installed by typing 
```markdown
microstate.functions.toolbox_path
```
in the MATLAB console. If installed correctly, this command returns a string containing the directory with the +microstate toolbox. Otherwise, you will receive an error.

The first time you run the toolbox, you need to install some additional files. This is done by typing
```
microstate.functions.install
```
This does not need to be run every time you use +microstate, but it is worth running occasionally since the command will additionally update the toolbox to the latest version if an older version is installed. 

## Getting started

For your first microstate analysis using +microstate, we recommend working through the tutorials. The toolbox-master folder contains a subfolder called "examples", which contains MATLAB Live Scripts to perform the four example analyses described in the [toolbox manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.13.452193). We recommend working through each tutorial in order, as these analyses increase in complexity and assume knowledge from previous examples.
