% Extract GFP peaks of the data. 
% 
% Useage: 
% Inputs: 
% - x: M/EEG data. TxP, where T is the number of time points and P is the
%      number of channels. 
% Outputs: 
% - xpk: Maps at peaks. NxP, where N is the number of peak maps. 
% - ind: Designation of maps to time series.
% 
% Global field potential is defined as the standard deviation of the EEG
% data at each time point. Peaks in GFP correspond to regions of highest
% signal to noise ratio, so are used to extract microstate maps [1].
